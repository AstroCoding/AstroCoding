# Mark Hutchison

I am a male University student, primarily a Web Designer, and an amazing coder who has experience with coding in the following languages:

- HTML
- SCSS, CSS
- JavaScript, jQuery
- PHP
- Python
- C++
- Java
- mySQL, SQLite

âš¡ Fun fact: I was a part of the Skills Canada Web Design and Development competition and placed Bronze, so it is safe to say that you can trust me when I say I know what I am talking about. Feel free to ask me about the experience, because man do I have stories!
